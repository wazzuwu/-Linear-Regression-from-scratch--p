# Linear Regression from Scratch 📈

**The Foundation of Machine Learning Engineering**

This repository contains a complete implementation of linear regression built from scratch using only NumPy. Understanding linear regression at this fundamental level is crucial for any machine learning engineer, as it forms the mathematical and conceptual foundation for more advanced algorithms.

## 🎯 Purpose

Linear regression is the "Hello World" of machine learning, yet mastering it from first principles is essential because:
- It introduces core ML concepts: hypothesis functions, cost functions, and optimization
- It demonstrates gradient descent, the backbone of neural network training
- It teaches you to think mathematically about learning algorithms
- It builds intuition for feature scaling, overfitting, and model evaluation

## 📊 Mathematical Foundation

### The Linear Model
Our model predicts output `y` using the linear hypothesis:
```
h(x) = mx + b
```
Where:
- `m` = slope (weight parameter)
- `b` = y-intercept (bias parameter)
- `x` = input feature
- `y` = predicted output

### Cost Function (Mean Squared Error)
We measure prediction accuracy using MSE:
```
J(m,b) = (1/n) * Σ(y_actual - y_predicted)²
```

### Gradient Descent Optimization
We minimize cost by updating parameters using gradients:
```
m = m - α * ∂J/∂m
b = b - α * ∂J/∂b
```
Where `α` is the learning rate.

## 🔍 Code Walkthrough

### Core Functions

**1. Prediction Function**
```python
def regression(x, m, b):
    return m*x + b
```
Implements our linear hypothesis h(x) = mx + b

**2. Loss Function**
```python
def loss(y, y_pred):
    return np.mean((y-y_pred)**2)
```
Calculates Mean Squared Error between actual and predicted values

**3. Parameter Update Function**
```python
def update(x, y, y_pred, m, b, lr=0.01):
    dm = -2*np.mean(x*(y-y_pred))      # Gradient w.r.t. slope
    db = -2*np.mean(y-y_pred)          # Gradient w.r.t. intercept
    new_m = m - lr*dm                   # Update slope
    new_b = b - lr*db                   # Update intercept
    return new_m, new_b
```
Performs one gradient descent step

### Training Loop
The algorithm iteratively:
1. Makes predictions using current parameters
2. Calculates loss (how wrong we are)
3. Computes gradients (which direction to move)
4. Updates parameters to reduce loss
5. Repeats until convergence

```

## 📈 Understanding the Results

The algorithm starts with:
- Initial slope (m) = 0.5
- Initial intercept (b) = 20
- Loss = 3048.9

After 1000 iterations:
- Optimized slope (m) ≈ 4.59
- Optimized intercept (b) ≈ 54.64
- Final loss ≈ 3.79

The dramatic loss reduction (3048.9 → 3.79) shows the algorithm successfully learned the underlying pattern in our data.

## 📚 Mathematical Derivations

### Gradient Derivation
For cost function J(m,b) = (1/n)Σ(y - (mx + b))²

**Partial derivative w.r.t. m:**
```
∂J/∂m = (2/n)Σ(y - (mx + b)) * (-x) = -(2/n)Σx(y - (mx + b))
```

**Partial derivative w.r.t. b:**
```
∂J/∂b = (2/n)Σ(y - (mx + b)) * (-1) = -(2/n)Σ(y - (mx + b))
```

These derivatives tell us exactly how to adjust parameters to minimize loss!
